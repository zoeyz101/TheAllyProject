### Inspiration
As two Asian women in tech, the current climate against Asian people is one that has brought great stress to us. We wanted to use this bootcamp as a way of using coding for social good on this battle against racism.

### What it does
Our site acts as a beginning guide to various levels of racism in the world through a variety of questions based on the pyramid of white supremacy. The questions range from themes of discrimination, veiled racism to indifference and allow for the user to read and understand that there are a variety of levels of allyship.

### How we built it
Figma was used to design the various pages of the application. The application was built using the React framework and React Bootstrap as a design library. It uses css and sass to stylize the different pages.

### Challenges we ran into
Our biggest issue in this 12 hour Bootcamp was the lack of time we had to complete the project. We would have loved to incorporate many more features including an info button to give more context as to why questions were being asked as well as a responsive answer after the questionnaire is complete. This would allow the user to gain targeted resources and information on how to be a better ally.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of how much we were able to accomplish in only 12 hours. Taking an idea from start to finish in such a short amount of time was such an amazing experience. Specifically, we are very proud of the level of design we created in this time.

### What's next for The Ally Project
The next step for our project would be to have a deployed version live as well as incorporate a backend database to store anonymous results and capture data about the users who are taking the quiz. We would also love to incorporate some of the ideas we did not get to develop as stated in previous sections.
